## What are you looking for in your next role?
Go back to tech oriented companies, learn new technologies and use them.

## What’s an example of a difficult problem you solved? Be specific about how the problem was diagnosed and your process for approaching it.

2. Debug the bug for file descriptor in nodejs library that produing duplicate fds for different files.
3. Maybe haar cascade in AI?

## A mistake

## Speak about a project you’re most passionate about or one that you felt exhibited your best work.
1. The AI project 
2. This project can help ppl and the community; AI is also the latest technology and I feel very excited when I can learn new things everyday.

## Can you tell me about your team’s decision-making process? What do you like and not like about it?
1. We usually sit in a room and brain sotrm, and discuss the pros and cons. Usually we inspire each other and get better ideas.
2. I would not say I do not like it, group discussion is always every exciting. But If I need to give a suggestion, I would say we can be more efficient on decision making on small things.

## Your manager comes into your office and gives you an assignment and asks for an estimate of how long it will take. You give them an estimate and they accept it. Halfway through the project you realize that you’ve underestimated the time it’ll take; it’ll actually take three times as long as you originally told your manager. What do you do?
1. I inform my manager immediately and explain why this is happening.
2. Then I would ask my manager who he has communicated this timeline to others, and decide from there.
3. If the impact is big, I will figure out a new plan like I will work overtime to get it done.
4. If still need help, I will see if there is any team members that can help me. Then I will ask with manager for approval.
5. Usually I give a buffer in my estimation to avoid this.
6. Buffer calculate: Base on similar projects i have done before; and base on my available time at the moment; And usually I leave 10% buffer.

## Tell me something you have to learn quickly but know nothing about it
1. Able to explain AI/ deep learning concepts
